Function Description
The chip adopts the single-wire communication method and uses the return-to-zero code to send signals. After the chip is powered on and reset, it accepts the call from the DIN terminal.
After receiving enough 48bit data, the DO port starts to forward data for the next chip to provide input data. Before forwarding, DO mouth one
Pull straight down. At this time, the chip will not accept new data, and the three PWM output ports of the chip OUTR, OUTG and OUTB will
48bit data, send out corresponding signals with different duty ratios, the signal period is about 1ms. If the input signal at the DIN terminal is a RESET signal,
The chip will send the received data to the display, and the chip will re-accept new data after the signal ends, and after receiving the first 48bit data,
The data is forwarded through the DO port. Before the chip receives the RESET code, the original outputs of the OUTR, OUTG and OUTB pins remain unchanged.
After receiving the low-level RESET code for more than 1.5ms, the chip outputs the 48bit PWM data pulse width just received to OUTR,
OUTG, OUTB pins

Data is 16 bits per color MSb first.
